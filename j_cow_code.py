###Defining Initial Position Conditions###
x0 = 0 #init x position is at origin
y0 = h #init y position defined as some arbitrary height
t0 = 0 #init time set to 0

###Defining Initial Velocity Conditions###
vx0 = 
vy0 = 

###Defining vectors that describe initial conditions###
r0 = [x0, y0] 
v0 = [vx0, vy0] 

###Defining Dynamical Relationships###
time_step = 1 #arbitrarily saying this = 1 second for now
t = t0 + time_step*

x = x0 + vx0*t
y = y0 + vy0*t

vx = vx0 - time_step*t
vy = vy0 - time_step*t



#basic script that can run indicated example, dont necesarily need to have questions answered
